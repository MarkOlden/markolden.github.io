Scope of the Project
--------------------
This is a diagramming or whiteboarding application, depending on which theme is selected. It is not an SVG editing app, the SVG export is designed only for embedding in web pages, not for further editing in other tools.

Running
-------
[Project Bohema](https://markolden.github.io/src/main/webapp/index.html) will have the full editor functionality.

Supported Browsers
------------------
Supports Chrome 70+, Firefox 70+, Safari 11+, Opera 50+, Native Android browser 7x+, the default browser in the current and previous major iOS versions (e.g. 11.2.x and 10.3.x) and Edge 79+.


P.S. The level of complexity of this project means that even simple changes 
can break a _lot_ of other moving parts. The amount of testing required 
is far more than it first seems.
